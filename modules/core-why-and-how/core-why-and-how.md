# Why and how?

---

## Why programming?

- Hopefully you don't seriously need to ask this question...
--

- Because software is an incredibly exciting __medium for artistic expression__
- Because software __pays the bills__
- Because software is __how the world works now__
- And __programming is how we create software__

---

## Why JavaScript?

- Because it is the __language of interactivity__ on the web
- Because it is a __good learning language__
- Because it is __incredibly popular__
- Because it has __countless libraries and extensions available__
- Because it is __not just for the web__

???

- Pretty much every fancy thing you see a web page do is done with JavaScript
- JavaScript is a great learning language because so many people use it for so many tasks. For any question you have, there is likely an answer online. For any genre of program you want to write, there is probably a community online.
- Perhaps most importantly for learning, JavaScript is a modern language with the standard suite of features we expect to see. Your knowledge of JavaScript will allow you to learn other languages much, much more easily.
- JavaScript has been around for a long time and has had many, many libraries and extensions created for it that give you greater power with less work! (More on this later in the course.)
- JavaScript isn't limited to programming for the web. With technologies like [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) you can build your own applications in JavaScript.

---

## Why p5.js?

- p5.js is a web-native, __JavaScript version of [Processing](https://processing.org/)__, the popular teaching environment
- It provides a __thoughtful and constrained set of elements__ to learn programming with
- Importantly, it allows us to __create visual programs quickly and easily__
- Check out some __[examples](https://p5js.org/examples/)__

---

## Why games and playful interaction?

- Because games and playful interaction are __computationally intensive__
- Because if we can program a game, we can __program pretty much anything__
- Because __it's just more fun__ to practice programming with games and play

---

## How do I learn programming? By being taught.

- This is a course designed to teach you programming in JavaScript
- From the ground up
- With the specific aim of giving you a solid foundation in the fundamentals
- And therefore the ability to expand your abilities moving forward

---

## How do I learn programming? By asking questions.

- This is a classroom where we absolutely welcome questions at any time
- If you're ever slightly confused, getting lost, have something to contribute: speak
- Class is far more interesting when people are asking questions
- If you have a question there is a high, high probability someone else is wishing someone would ask it too
- (For another thing it's part of your participation grade!)

---

## How do I learn programming? By practicing.

- Programming can often make perfectly good sense when someone explains it to you
- It's logical, there aren't that many scary concepts (really!)
- But the only way you really learn is to practice
- You should __spend a lot of time programming__

???

- Unsurprisingly it's not unlike learning anything practical
- When you learn the guitar, it's one thing to listen to someone tell you the different strings and how frets work and then watch them play a song using that information
- But it's very different getting your brain to understand how to __do__ that
- So you have to practice

---

## How do I learn programming? By experimenting.

- Programming can be intimidating because it's easy for things to go wrong
- That can scare us away from just playing around with it
- But playing around with code is extremely fun, and a great way to learn what's possible
- When you're just starting you can't really just "make stuff up", but you can definitely play around with __numbers__, for example
- Whenever we use a number, why not try using some ridiculous numbers instead and see what happens?
- It's a great way to learn more about how programming behaves in the real world

---

## How do I learn programming? By helping others.

- Like any classroom, there will be different abilities distributed among you
- If you can help someone else with something, do it - it will help you learn the concepts better too
- But do remember that everyone here is trying to learn, so give people space to work things out for themselves

---

## How do I learn p5?

- As we delve into programming a question will arise: "How the heck am I supposed to _know_ the names and parameters and effects of all this stuff???"
--

- It's a good question, and the answer is: __documentation__
--

- __Nobody "just knows"__ all the possible functions and their parameters
- All of us are _constantly_ looking things up to remember them or to find new things
- Getting used to reading documentation is a crucial skill
--

- For now, the most important documentation for us is [The p5 Reference](https://p5js.org/reference/).

---

## The p5 Reference

- Go to https://p5js.org/reference/
--

- As you can see, it provides you with a list of __every function that p5 provides__
- In a very real sense, this collection of functions _is p5_, this is what it does
- There are two obvious ways to use the reference:
--

  - First, you can _look up_ the specifics of a function you're trying to use
--

  - Second, you can _browse_ the reference to discover new possibilities!
--

- The reference is especially nice in that it pretty much always provides example code that illustrates what a function does

---

## Use the reference!

- It's not rocket science to say that if you're uncertain about how a function works your __first__ action should be to read the appropriate page in the reference
- Unsure of what the first two numbers you give the `ellipse()` function mean?
--
 Go to the [`ellipse()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/ellipse) page in the reference and find out they are the (x,y) coordinates for the ellipse!
--

- Wondering how to generate a random number?
--
 Search the reference for the word "random" and find the [`random()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/random) page that tells you how to do it!
--

- Of course, be aware that you might run into things you don't understand yet
- But by the end of the course __every single thing in the reference will be understandable to you__

---

## How can I learn JavaScript more generally?

- p5 is a very specific way of thinking about JavaScript
- In particular the reference doesn't actually tell you about the fundamentals of programming
- Apart from this course, there are __many__ resources online, maybe __too many__
- Check out the [Course Resources](../../course_information/Course-Resources.md) page for some suggestions

---

## Don't use the internet too much!

- There's so much information about programming on the internet
- Try to resist diving all the way in before you quite know what you're doing
- For this course you hopefully shouldn't __need__ other resources, even though they can of course be helpful
- Most especially __please resist taking code from online and using it in your own projects__
- Naturally people do this in the real world, but when we're learning it tends to cause far more trouble than it's worth

---

## So... why?

- Because knowing how to program is probably one of the single most important skills you can have today
- Because making art and interactive experiences and websites and videogames is incredibly fun and rewarding

---

## And... how?

- Follow the course
- Practice
- Experiment
- Read the p5 reference
- Read online resources about programming
- __Don't rely too much on finding solutions online__
