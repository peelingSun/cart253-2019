- These slides are written in [remark.js](https://github.com/gnab/remark) which allows text written in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to be displayed as slides

---

## Slides and notes

- You are encouraged to follow along with the slides on your own computer, just click the appropriate link in the [Course Schedule](https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart253-2018/blob/master/course_information/Course-Schedule.md)
- When viewing the slides, press `F` for full-screen and `P` for presenter view
- You can also view the information from the slides as __notes__ by clicking on the appropriate link - when you view them as notes the presenter notes are visible by default

???

- This is an example of a presenter note which can be seen in the 'notes' version of this presentation

## Course resources

- The [Course Resources](https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart253-2018/blob/master/course_information/Course-Resources.md) page is... on GitHub

- However the course is designed to be self-sufficient so don't feel like you have to read them all

## Course software setup

- There is a page about [Course Software Setup](https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart253-2018/blob/master/course_information/Course-Software-Setup.md) on... what? GitHub? That's right!

- If you haven't, do it now quietly while still listening to the class
