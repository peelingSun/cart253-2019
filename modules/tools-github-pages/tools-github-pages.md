## What is GitHub Pages?

- GitHub Pages is a very helpful service provided by GitHub
- Specifically, it allows us to view a repository __as a hosted website__
- This means that if our repository contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (which ours do), we can view it in a browser online , hosted by GitHub
- And that also means we can show our work to other people easily!

---

## Activating GitHub Pages

1. Go to https://www.github.com/
2. Log in if needed
3. Go to your `cart253-2018` repository on the website (https://www.github.com/yourusername/cart253-2018/)
4. Click on the __Settings__ tab at the top right (next to __Insights__)
5. Scroll down to the __GitHub Pages__ section
6. Under __Source__, choose `master branch`
7. Click __Save__

## Viewing GitHub Pages websites

- Now that GitHub Pages is active you can view your repository as a website
- The URL to view works like this

`https://yourusername.github.io/repositoryname/path/to/site`

- So to view __my__ Exercise 1, for example, you would use

`https://pippinbarr.github.io/cart253-2018/exercises/exercise1/`

- Yours should be similar, with a different username and possibly a different path if you did something slightly differently.
- Note that the path you specify should have an `index.html` file inside it for the browser to display (browsers display HTML)

---

## That's it!

- It's wonderfully simple
- This also means you can host other websites and projects on GitHub Pages if you start new repositories for those projects!
- Again, we will use the `cart253-2018` repository for __all our work__ in this class
