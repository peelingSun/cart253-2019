It's a good idea to learn some keyboard shortcuts for use with various applications to speed up your workflow. Here are some examples. If you want to add any, email Pippin <[pippin.barr@concordia.ca](mailto:pippin.barr@concordia.ca)> and he'll update this file.

These shortcuts are written for Mac OS X. Generally speaking, if you replace Command with Control and Option with Alt on Windows they will still work.
