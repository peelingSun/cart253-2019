## Territorial acknowledgment

We acknowledge that Concordia University is located on unceded Indigenous lands. The Kanien’kehá:ka Nation is recognized as the custodians of the lands and waters on which we gather today. Tiohtiá:ke/Montreal is historically known as a gathering place for many First Nations. Today, it is home to a diverse population of Indigenous and other peoples. We respect the continued connections with the past, present and future in our ongoing relationships with Indigenous and other peoples within the Montreal community.

## Description

Learning to program is at the heart of understanding computation. In this course we cover an introduction to the key elements of programming, all while emphasising experimental and playful approaches to software aesthetics. Students will spend time both learning the basics of how to program while also producing their own original work in a studio environment.


## Learning Objectives

After completing this course, students should be able to:

* Read, understand and write JavaScript
* Comfortable use the arts-oriented library p5 to solve problems and create work
* Use programming as a way to create interactive digital media that explores and expresses their ideas


## Key activities

### Lecture
Each class will include time spent with the instructor running through the week's programming topics, showing examples, and doing live coding to illustrate ideas.

### Weekly exercises
Most weeks will include an evaluated exercise in which students will write their own code to illustrate their mastery of the concepts covered that week.

### Projects
There will be three graded projects during the course. Each will be used as an opportunity for students to practice and develop their programming skills within a provided framework, but with more room for their own creative ideas.

### Studio
All classes will include significant time for students to work on their projects and exercises with the instructor and a teaching assistant present to support both their technical and conceptual approach.


## Expected skills

Students are _not_ expected to have any programming background at all. Instead, students are expected to have the desire and willingness to learn and push themselves to learn programming, and to engage deeply with thinking about creating interactive digital media through code.


## GitHub

GitHub will replace the Moodle for this course. You are on GitHub now! The course GitHub repository will contain example code, slides, a wiki with course information, and more. Students will be able to edit the wiki as well as register issues with GitHub's issue tracker as needed.

Additionally, students will create their own repository on GitHub to save, track, and submit their coursework.


## Evaluation

Specific evaluation requirements will be provided when assigned.

* Weekly exercises (20%)
   * 8 exercises worth 2.5% each
* Projects (60%)
  * Project 1 (10%)
  * Project 2 (20%)
  * Project 3 (30%)
* Participation (20%)
   * Participation includes attendance, asking questions, asking for help, contributing to discussions, editing the wiki to share ideas, participating in critiques, and coming to office hours (even if it's just to show off your work!)


## French

Students have the right to write in French at Concordia. Pippin can read French at an intermediate level, but naturally this may impact the quality of feedback possible (especially on writing skills). Presenting in French is to be avoided. Given that this is a programming course, this means you are welcome to name variables and functions in French as well as to write comments in French.


## Policy

* Late work of any kind will lose one letter grade per day late, beginning immediately after the deadline (e.g. if it is two days late, work that would have received a B would lose two letter grades and receive a C+)
* Concordia University has an [Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.concordia.ca/students/academic-integrity.html) which must be followed.
* It is departmental policy that three (3) unexcused absences results in failing the course.
* It is class policy that being fifteen (15) or more minutes late without a reasonable excuse counts as an absence.


## Costs

* The compulsory per semester [departmental fee ($50)](https://stores.concordia.ca/usage-of-consumable-materials-at-d-cart-labs-and-equipment-borrowing-privileges-from-cda-197b1b.html) covering lab maintenance, workshops, and equipment borrowing privileges from the depot.
* Students who plan to use the lab computers will need [a CDA account ($45)](http://www.concordia.ca/finearts/cda/membership.html).
* All software students are expected to use in the class will be free.
* Where relevant, students are welcome to work with software not available at the university but will obviously need to purchase and maintain it for themselves.


## The lab

The practical work done in this class will take place in the computer lab EV 5.815 which contains 23 dual-boot Mac/Windows machines. In order to use the machines you will need a CDA account (as above). In addition, it is vital to know and remember that **the computers do not keep work that you leave on their hard-drives**. As we will be working with version control, however, this should be a non-issue.

You are of course welcome to use your own laptops and computers to the extent that you are able to install and manage the appropriate software on it, and the instructor will work to support that within reason.
