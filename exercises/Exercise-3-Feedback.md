# Exercise 3 Feedback

- This is the final week for flexibility on issues around commenting, indenting, whitespace, or naming. From next week sufficient problems with these will be a fail.

## Submission


## Naming

- Still some poorly named variables - make sure they're in camelCase and __specific__. `x` can be very vague, where as `targetX` tells us what it's the x location of. 

## Commenting

- Still seeing people not updating the comment at the top of the script. This will cause a fail from the next exercise.
- Similarly still seeing people not updating other comments when they change the code associated with them. This will also be a fail.

## Commits

- Still seeing some people not using the prefix "Ex3:" before their commit message. This will cause a fail from the next exercise.

## Style

- Still some indenting issues. Use `atom-beautify`.
