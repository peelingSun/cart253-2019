## Challenges

As always, begin by downloading the original game ([game-wheres-sausage-dog.zip](../games/game-wheres-sausage-dog.zip)). Add it to your repository and commit it as "Ex3: Started exercise 3". Then complete and commit each challenge below separately with a descriptive commit messages (including the exercise prefix). Remember to comment your work.

1. Improve the user interface of the game by displaying the image you're searching for in the top right corner against a colored background rectangle (to make it easier to see).
2. Add a text caption to the image you just added that serves as an instruction, like "CHIEN PERDU" or "Where am I?" or something (so people know what they're doing).
3. Make winning more exciting than it is now. Make the sausage dog move on the screen when you've won (it will need velocity variables and a speed variable). (Extras: Maybe have it wrap around the edges, or bounce off them? Maybe turn off the `background()` drawing so it leaves a trail? Maybe it can shrink and grow as well?)
4. Tune the game's difficulty to a level you like by changing how large the images are displayed (remember you can set height and width in `image()`) and how many there are. (Extras: Make the game get harder after each success.)

__Optional__ challenge: If you're advanced and know about arrays, can you work out how to use a __random__ image as the one the player is looking for? Can you add a restart option at the end so that the player can try again with a new image?
