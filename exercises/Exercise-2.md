## Challenges

As always, begin by downloading the start code ([game-the-artful-dodger.zip](../games/game-the-artful-dodger.zip)). Rename the folder to `exercise2`. Add it to your repository and commit it as "Ex2: Started exercise 2". Then complete and commit each challenge below separately with a descriptive commit messages. Remember to comment your work.

1. Change the game to display the number of successful dodges in the game itself (use the `text()` function for this) with nice typography (e.g. use `textFont()`, `textAlign()`, `textSize()`, `fill()`, etc.)
2. Change the game so that the enemy increases in size and speed by a set amount (use variables) each time you successfully dodge it, make sure you reset the size and speed of the enemy when the player loses
3. Change the visuals of the game using shapes and/or images with different fills/strokes/strokeWeights/etc., including changing the background, the enemy, and the player
4. Change the game to add at least one new `if` statement that changes the game further (the condition could be based on enemy and player positions or speeds, the score, keyboard input, mouse buttons, etc. and could change the graphics, speeds, positions, scores, etc. - maybe the background color could change at certain scores, for example)

_Completely optional challenge_: After doing all this, are you able to turn this into a mobile-friendly game? You'd have to replace the keyboard controls with touch controls and think about the aspect ratio.
