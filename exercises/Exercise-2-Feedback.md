# Exercise 2 Feedback

Starting from exercise 3 there will be less flexibility on these issues - exercises will fail if they don't live up to the basic requirements.

## Submission
- Definitely make sure you meet all the challenge requirements

## Naming
- Avoid super generic variable names like `img1` and use accurate, descriptive names like `dogImage`

## Commenting
- Update your comments! Make sure they reflect the code they are attached to. You wouldn't leave a caption that said "This is a dog" after you changed the picture to a cat, right?
- Make sure you include and change the top comment (people often leave Pippin's name there)
- Make sure you have a comment before __every__ function explaining what it does. `preload()` is a common place where people neglected to have a comment.
- If you have commented out some code you no longer need, delete it all before the final submission.

## Commits
- Make sure you commit message is descriptive of what you actually changed (not "added stuff" or "it's not working" or "ha ha :P")
- Make sure commit message starts with the exercise prefix, e.g. "Ex2: Added an outline to the enemy".

## Style
- Watch your indenting. Just use atom-beautify.
- Watch out for excess white space between lines of code.
- Likewise, make sure you do include enough white space to keep the work readable (e.g. a blank line between the end of a function and the start of the next)
