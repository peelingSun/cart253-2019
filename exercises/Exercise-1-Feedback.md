# Exercise 1 Feedback

For the first couple of exercises we'll go easy on exercises that break a couple of the rules of commenting, naming, structure, etc., but as we go further any serious issues in any of the five areas will lead to a fail. Please read the notes and the feedback and make sure you correct any common problems you're having. Ask for help if you need it!

## Submission
- Please remember to check whether the links you submitted actually work - click them and make sure that the code link points to the folder with your project files in it and that the site link point to a working version of your project.
- Please always change the author at the top of the script to be YOUR name, it's your baby!

## Naming
- Try to make variable names specific - they should explain what the variable contains! e.g. not just "picture" but "catPicture" or even "sadCatPicture"
- Remember to rename variables especially if you cut and paste them from example code! They need to be relevant to what YOU are doing.

## Commenting
- Remember to update comments so they match the code (e.g. if you add something to an empty function, make sure the function's descriptive comment is updated too)
- Delete comments that are no longer relevant
- Remove any commented-out code for final submission - we should only see the code that actually runs in the script.
- Remember to add comments for all added variables to explain what they're for.

## Commits
- Remember to include the exercise prefix in your commit messages: "Ex1: Added clown image", not just "Added clown image".
- Commit messages should describe what you changed, not how you feel about it at the time etc.

## Style
- Use === to check equality, not ==
- Avoid hardcoded numbers in your program as much as possible - try to always replace them with a variable (it makes the work more legible and opens the possibility for more interesting work later)
- Indent your code correctly - consider using Atom Beautify (a package you can install that formats your code every time you save)
- Keep your global (at the top) variables all declared together
- Avoid excess whitespace (e.g. don't have lots of blank lines)

## Structure
- Load images in preload() not in setup()
