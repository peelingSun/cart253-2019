# Atom Git

- GitHub Desktop is a useful application and it works.
- However, we __can__ do our basic committing and pushing directly inside Atom if we want!

## To Commit

1. Click the (tiny) "Git" button in the bottom right of Atom
2. Click "Stage All" it add all the changed files to the list of things to commit (called "Staged Changes")
3. Write a commit message as per usual
4. Click "Commit to master"

Now the changed files have been committed to the local repository

## To Push

1. Click the (tiny) "Push" button in the bottom right of Atom
2. (Log in if necessary.)

Now the changed files have been pushed to the remote repository on github.com
