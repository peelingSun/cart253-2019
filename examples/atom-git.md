# Atom Git

- GitHub Desktop is a useful application and it works.
- However, we __can__ do our basic committing and pushing directly inside Atom if we want!

## To Commit

1. Click the (tiny) "Git" button in the bottom right of Atom
2. Click "Stage All" it add all the changed files to the list of things to commit (called "Staged Changes")
3. Write a commit message as per usual
4. Click "Commit to master"

Now the changed files have been committed to the local repository

__If you don't see anything in the Git window, try closing it with the x button in its tab and then reopening it, or worst case try restarting Atom__

## To Push

1. Click the (tiny) "Push" button in the bottom right of Atom
2. (Log in if necessary.)

Now the changed files have been pushed to the remote repository on github.com
